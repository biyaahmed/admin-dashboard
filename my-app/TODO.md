 # Fix 404 Refresh Issue on cPanel

## Completed Steps
- [x] Updated App.js to use BrowserRouter (clean URLs)
- [x] Created .htaccess file for server-side routing

## Remaining Steps
- [ ] Build the updated application
- [ ] Deploy the new build to cPanel (including .htaccess file)
- [ ] Test routing and page refresh functionality

## Build Command
```bash
cd my-app
npm run build
```

## Deployment Instructions
1. Run the build command above
2. Upload the entire `build` folder to your cPanel hosting
3. Make sure the `.htaccess` file is included in the build folder
4. Test by navigating to different pages and refreshing

## Notes
- Using BrowserRouter with .htaccess for clean URLs (e.g., `yourdomain.com/dashboard`)
- The .htaccess file redirects all non-existent file/directory requests to index.html
- This allows React Router to handle client-side routing properly
- The 404 refresh issue should now be resolved
